# Quick SEO Audit Tools

## Summary

CLI tools to quickly collect data and help audit webpages with tedious SEO tasks in mind.

When creating, auditing, and QA-ing web content with accessibility, user experience, organic search, and other goals in mind, there are many tools that help identify problems on a siteâ€”tools like Semrush, SiteImprove, and Google Search Console all play an important role in everyday auditing workflows. However, we find that many of these tools do not provide the granularity or prompt collection of data to quickly and efficiently resolve pressing issues across our sites.

To help fill this gap, Quick SEO Audit Tools provides an extendable base to quickly audit copy, links, and other important site elements from the command line.
